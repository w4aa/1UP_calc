# 1UP Engine Configuration
# Settings for the early payout pricing calculator

# ============================================
# Active Engine
# ============================================
# FTS-Calibrated-DP: FTS-anchored DP with post-FTS calibration (provider-aware)
active_engine: FTSCalibratedDPEngine

# ============================================
# Calibration Settings
# ============================================
calibration:
  # Probability adjustments applied to calculated 1UP probabilities
  # Positive values increase probability, negative values decrease
  # Range: ±0.10000 (±10 percentage points)
  home_skew: 0.00000
  away_skew: 0.00000

# ============================================
# Simulation Settings
# ============================================
simulation:
  # Number of Monte Carlo simulations per event
  # Higher = more accurate but slower
  # Recommended: 30000-50000 for production, 10000 for testing
  n_sims: 50000
  
  # Match duration in minutes (including added time)
  match_minutes: 95
  # Timing weight magnitude: maps first-goal market imbalance -> alpha scalars
  # Larger values make the stronger-first-goal side score relatively earlier.
  # Tune this to match historical first-goal timing curves. Suggested range: 0.0-2.0

# ============================================
# Parallel Processing Settings
# ============================================
parallel:
  # Enable parallel event processing (much faster on multi-core CPUs)
  enabled: true
  
  # Number of worker threads (null = auto-detect based on CPU count)
  # Recommended: Leave null or set to CPU core count
  max_workers: null

# ============================================
# Output Settings
# ============================================
output:
  # Decimal places for odds display
  odds_precision: 2
  
  # Decimal places for probability display
  prob_precision: 2
